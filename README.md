Sure, here's a README.md file that includes some visual elements for the "Moving Stars" example:

# Moving Stars

A simple JavaScript program that creates a moving star effect where the stars element follows the mouse pointer.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Move your mouse around the page to see the stars follow your cursor.


## Code

Here's the JavaScript code that listens for mouse movement events on the entire document using the `addEventListener()` method:

```js
const stars = document.querySelector(".stars");

document.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  let x = e.pageX;
  let y = e.pageY;
  stars.style.left = x + "px";
  stars.style.top = y + "px";
});
```

The CSS code styles the `.stars` element to be a small white circle:

```css
.stars {
  position: absolute;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
